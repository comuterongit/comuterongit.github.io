		<p class="paragraph">I am Comuter (The Human, not the character) and Comuter is my character. Not confusing at all... right? No? Good. I am Non-Binary and I go by any pronouns (they/them is preferred, but I don't really care). I'm a silly german person who tries to stay out of it, but somehow always manages to end up engaging in political discussions. Probably addicted to DELTARUNE, as most of my Twitter bookmarks are fanart and other UTDR-related things.</p>

		<h2>Meet Comuter! (My character)</h2>
		<p class="paragraph">Comuter is infact <b class="yellow">not</b> a computer. It's a humanoid with a monitor head. It lives in Antarctica, 7000 years in a post-nuclear war era, where the Earth has slightly recovered. Comuter travels through time and space just to explore, which is why it's able to be on the internet. It can't talk (No speakers connected), therefore it puts the words on its monitor. Comuter also has a <a href="https://bsky.app/comuter.at">Bluesky</a> account, where it occasionally posts some of its thoughts.</p>
